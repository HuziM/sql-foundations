###Incorporating CASE LOGIC INTO WHERE CLAUSES
###10. Filter based on a business rule that changes by category
SELECT ST.*, P.category
FROM "Sales_Transactions" ST
JOIN "Product" P ON ST.product_id = P.product_id
WHERE ST.amount >
  CASE 
    WHEN P.category = 'Electronics' THEN 400
    WHEN P.category = 'Accessories' THEN 100
    ELSE 0
  END;

###11: Show transactions based on different date ranges per product
SELECT ST.*, P.product_name
FROM "Sales_Transactions" ST
JOIN "Product" P ON ST.product_id = P.product_id
WHERE ST.transaction_date >= 
  CASE 
    WHEN P.price >= 500 THEN CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 days'
    ELSE CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
  END;
